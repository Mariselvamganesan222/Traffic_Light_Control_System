# 🚦 Traffic Light Control System using MSP430G2553

This project demonstrates a **Traffic Light Control System** implemented using the **MSP430G2553** microcontroller. The system uses LED indicators to simulate real-world traffic lights, controlled through embedded C programming.

## 🔥 Features
✅ Programmed in **C** for embedded systems.  
✅ Simulates real-world **traffic light sequences**.  
✅ Uses **GPIO pin manipulation** for LED control.  
✅ Implements **delay cycles** for light transitions.  
✅ Provides hands-on experience with **MSP430 microcontroller programming**.

## 🛠️ Hardware & Software Requirements
- **MSP430G2553 LaunchPad**
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Resistors (330Ω)
- Power Supply
- **Code Composer Studio (CCS)** or any compatible MSP430 IDE
- USB Debugging Interface
